# Getting Started

To get a copy of the code, you can either fork the repository, download it as a ZIP file, or clone it using Git.

## Fork the Repository

1. Go to the repository on GitHub. [https://github.com/krishsub/MultiagentHackathon](https://github.com/krishsub/MultiagentHackathon)
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.
3. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Download as ZIP

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Code" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP".
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.

## Clone with Git

1. Open your terminal.
2. Choose an appropriate top-level directory (e.g. C:\Users\\<you\>\mycode)
3. Create this top-level directory (`code` in above example) and navigate to it
from the command line
4. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied (either this repo or yours 
if you forked it).

That's it! You now have a copy of the code.

## Important:
* Right-click the <code>MultiagentHackthon</code> folder and open in VS Code
* Within VS Code, open the folder in devcontainer when prompted
* This will take many minutes while the docker image and dependencies are
downloaded (one time)
* Once the devcontainer opens, ***don't*** create a Python virtual 
environment/Conda if prompted, just close that window (we are already in a
virtual environment with devcontainers)
